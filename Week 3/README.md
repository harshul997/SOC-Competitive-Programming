## ðŸ“… Week 3 (10 June â€“ 18 June)

### ðŸ“– Reading Material

- Read Chapters 6, 7 and 10 from [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://github.com/harshul997/SOC-Competitive-Programming/blob/main/Resources/Competitive%20Programmers%20Handbook%20-%20Antti%20Laaksonen.pdf).
- Read Chapter 6 from [Guide to Competitive Programming](https://github.com/harshul997/SOC-Competitive-Programming/blob/main/Resources/Guide%20to%20Competitive%20Programming.pdf).
- If you have time, then please read Chapters 4 and 6 from [Algorithm Design](https://github.com/harshul997/SOC-Competitive-Programming/blob/main/Resources/Algorithm%20Design%20by%20Jon%20Kleinberg%2C%20Eva%20Tardos.pdf). It is a great resource for greedy-dp. A shorter version can be found [CS218](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rgurjar/CS218-2025/)(Go through the slides, and also try to solve problem sheet of greedy and dp, you can also solve problem sheet of basic section.). Another resource: [Chapters 14-15](https://github.com/harshul997/SOC-Competitive-Programming/blob/main/Resources/Introduction%20to%20Algorithms%20-%203rd%20Edition.pdf). These techniques are widely used in a variety of questions. So, better to read and practice as much as you can!

### ðŸ“š Optional Reading

- You are now eligible to complete the first three sections of [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/). In fact I strongly recommend you complete atleast first half of all those sections as you get time.
